the costs of additional booster doses in sensitivity analyses.
   Direct medical costs for screening and treatment were derived

study of time costs associated with cervical cancer screening
(94), and previously published data incorporating transportation
costs were used in sensitivity analyses.
   Selected quality weights are shown in Table 1 (88,96,97).
Quality weights for each health state, which ranged from 0 to
1, where a weight of 1 corresponds to perfect health and a
weight of 0 corresponds to a health state judged equivalent to
death, were multiplied by the time spent in the state and then
summed to calculate the number of quality-adjusted life
years. Age-specific quality weights were used for noncancer
states, as recommended by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in
Health and Medicine (14,96). The quality weights for the time
spent in cancer health states were derived from utility esti-
mates by the Committee to Study Priorities for Vaccine
Development (Institute of Medicine) (88) and varied with
stage of disease. The plausible ranges for these quality
weights were established by use of the lowest and highest
values reported in the literature (88,96,97). Sensitivity anal-

   *Average per woman lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and reduction in lifetime risk of cervical cancer associated with three basic cervical cancer
prevention strategies: 1) no vaccination and no screening, 2) no vaccination and cytologic screening, and 3) vaccination and cytologic screening. Strategies differ
by type of cytologic screening (e.g., conventional versus liquid-based screening, age at which screening is initiated, frequency of screening, and use of vaccination
with 90% efficacy as an adjunct to cytologic screening). Strategies shown are the most efficient strategies (i.e., non-dominated) of a total of 80 strategies evaluated.
Strategies that were dominated were either less effective and more costly (i.e., strongly dominated) or more costly and less cost-effective (i.e., weakly dominated)
than the strategies shown. Vaccine efficacy was defined as prevention of 90% of persistent human papillomavirus 16/18 (HPV16/18) infections. Costs have been
rounded to the nearest whole dollar. QALY ⫽ quality-adjusted life-year.
  †The difference in cost divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life expectancy for each strategy compared with the next best strategy. All strategies are
assumed to be equally available.
  ‡Cost-effectiveness ratios are often placed in context by comparisons with interventions that are widely mandated. As such, a cost-effectiveness ratio of less than
$75 000 per quality-adjusted life year gained would be considered good value for resources (i.e., a cost-effective intervention) in the United States (14).

92% reduction in cervical cancer incidence, and costs approxi-
mately $50 000 per quality-adjusted life year. As a general rule,
with more effective vaccines, less frequent cytologic screening
produced equivalent protection against cancer. For example,
with a vaccine that prevents 100% of persistent HPV16/18
infections, the same level of cancer protection may be obtained
(92% reduction in lifetime cancer risk), but screening frequency
may be decreased to every 5 years rather than every 3 years.

Other Sensitivity Analyses

    Results were most sensitive to alternative assumptions about
the 1) duration of vaccine efficacy; 2) proportion of persistent
HPV in women older than 30 years attributable to newly ac-
quired HPV infection versus reactivation of infection acquired in
earlier adulthood; and 3) underlying frequency of cervical can-
cer screening, age at which screening is initiated, and cost of
following women with atypical cytologic screening results and
low-grade lesions. Results were less sensitive to plausible
changes in the natural history parameters, screening test char-
acteristics, cervical cancer mortality, and costs.
    Although the clinical benefits of vaccination diminish pro-
portionally with decreasing vaccination coverage, the incremen-
tal cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination in the base case was
not sensitive to plausible changes in vaccine costs because the
unvaccinated proportion of the cohort did not accrue the costs of
vaccination. In contrast, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination
strategies improved as screening coverage decreased (i.e., as the
proportion of the population never screened was increased). For
example, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding a
vaccine with 90% efficacy against persistent HPV infections to
current screening practice in the United States is less than
$25 000 per quality-adjusted life year. Adding this same vaccine
to a hypothetical screening program in which all women comply
with every scheduled screening session exceeds $50 000 per
quality-adjusted life year.
    In strategies that combined vaccination and screening, the
choice of conventional versus liquid-based cytologic screening
depends mainly on their relative costs and test characteristics.
For example, when the cost of conventional cytologic screening
is doubled, vaccination combined with liquid-based cytologic
screening is preferred. When the sensitivity of conventional
cytologic screening is reduced to less than 50%, liquid-based
cytologic screening is preferred. Our cost-effectiveness results           Fig. 3. Sensitivity analysis of vaccination waning. The impact of waning (i.e.,
